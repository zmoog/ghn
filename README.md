# ogh

Opinionated GitHub CLI tool.

The GitHub CLI is great, and I use it all the time. However, it doesn't have a way to list notifications and issues the way I like.

This tool aims to fill that gap.

## Getting Started

```sh
# List issues by repository
ogh issues list-by-repo elastic elastic-serverless-forwarder --days-ago 3 
```
